# Classification_Project


## Project description
This project is to determin factors that contribute to customer churn for the TELCO company. The data collected from this project can helpwith future planning on ways to decrease customer churn and improve loyalty with the TELCO brand.

## Goals
This project goal is to determine factors of churn, and identify customers at higher risk of churn, so that the TELCO coporation can estbalish potential interventions to mitigate customer churn. 

## Questions 
1. Does  contract type impact the churn?
2. Does features play significant role in December 


## Initial Hypotheses 

Initial Hypotheses 
Hypothesis 1 
    • alpha = .05 
    • H0= Contract type has no significance on customer churn 
    • Ha= Contract type has significant impact on customer churn 
    • Outcome: #we accept or rejected the Null Hypothesis. 
Hypothesis 2 
    • alpha = .05 
    • H0 = Features has no significance on customer churn rates 
    • Ha = Features has signfiicant impact on customer churn rates 
    • Outcome: #we accept or rejected the Null Hypothesis.

## Data Dictionary
There are 25 columns, the main target column will be ‘customer_churn’. It is an object datatype with two unique variable: Yes or No. 


## Project Planning (data science pipeline)
1.Identify the problem you wish to investigate. - Why are customers churning?
2.Identify source of data to use "telco.csv" database 
3. Create a README.md with all information required.
4..Create aquire.py, prepare.py which should have functions: to acquire data, prepare data, and split the data.
5. Create .gitignore file to keep the environment safe from exploitation of sensitive information to public add env and other files that should be used with discretion
6. Create non-final notebook(s) to explore, train, validate and test data. Use functions from the non-final notebook to import finished and polished work to the final notebook.

7. In final notebook, we will import those best models.
8. Create a Prediction csv file to aggregate test prediction.
9. Document conclusion, takeaways, and recommendation for future testing in the Final notebook.
